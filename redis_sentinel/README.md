# Redis-Sentinel

Redis sentinel is the high availability solution offered by Redis. In case of 
a failure in your Redis cluster, Sentinel will automatically detects the point
of failure and bring the cluster back to stable mode without any human
intervention.

To this example a docker configuration was created to simulate many 
redis-sentinel instances.
